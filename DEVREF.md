# The Colony Developer Reference (DEVREF)

This document is the main entry point to a collection of documents
spread through the codebase and in the `devref/` directory which try to
explain and document from an engine developer point of view: the
structure and layout of the engine, algorithms, packages, reasons for
why something is written the way that it is, etc, etc. Often this
institutional knowledge is more in-depth, at a higher level, or needing
more discourse or explanation than the raw documentation strings
available in Common Lisp.
